# EMG_Flex_Extd_project
**Introduction:**
This project focuses on analyzing Electromyography (EMG) signals to examine muscle activity during wrist flexion and extension movements. 
Specifically, it looks at the Flexor Carpi Radialis and Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus muscles, with a goal to compare the muscle activity under different conditions.
The project has applications in understanding musculoskeletal disorders, such as arthritis, and can be useful in therapeutic treatments.
